## ðŸ§© Project Overview

Victor Rover integrates several core robotics systems:

- **Motion Control** â€” Handles robot velocity and steering using the Pure Pursuit algorithm.
- **Path Planning** â€” Implements A* and waypoint-based navigation.
- **Simulation** â€” Runs in Gazebo for realistic physics and RViz for visualization.
- **Mapping and Localization** â€” Publishes Occupancy Grid maps and navigation paths.
