# ðŸš€ Victor Rover

**Victor Rover** is a ROS 2 (Humble) based mobile robot project designed for autonomous motion and navigation.  
It includes motion control, path planning, and visualization in **Gazebo** and **RViz** simulation environments.

---

## ðŸ§© Project Overview

Victor Rover integrates several core robotics systems:

- **Motion Control** â€” Handles robot velocity and steering using the Pure Pursuit algorithm.
- **Path Planning** â€” Implements A* and waypoint-based navigation.
- **Simulation** â€” Runs in Gazebo for realistic physics and RViz for visualization.
- **Mapping and Localization** â€” Publishes Occupancy Grid maps and navigation paths.
